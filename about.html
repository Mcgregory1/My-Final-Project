Rayos, all esteemed ilokano's, built the Tubao Institute, a school which offered primary, secondary, and vocational education. The Institute was renamed to McGregory Junior College after the Second World War, expanded its course offerings and added a Graduate School. In 1950, the school was transformed and became McGregory University.</td>

        <td>McGregory University continued to offer its brand of premier local education in 2009, after its acquisition by McGregory University. Through McGregory University leadership and management, the college further developed its existing academic programs by employing non-traditional approaches to learning. 

To date, there are two campuses: in Tubao La Union, and in Agoo. Through McGregory University, Tubao La Union is realizing its goal of providing better quality yet affordable education to more Filipinos. Graduates from McGregory University continue to excel in board examinations, particularly in nursing and engineering.</td>
